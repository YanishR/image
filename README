Image from image.py is a simple class
that enables background removal from an
image.

It's usage is not well written but this is how to use
it for the moment.

Usage:

In main.py, write the url of the image for the 
variable img_url.

Then, run main as so:
    python main.py

If the background removal is poor,
   with the plotted axis, adjust
   the frame of the main object.

Comment out line 11 to help with this.
rectangle's arguments are as such
(start x, start y, end x, end y)


Final images are saved in pics/final
